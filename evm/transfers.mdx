The EVM Transfers endpoint provides access to historical token transfer events for a specified address. This endpoint is ideal for tracking transaction history and analyzing token movements over time.
### Endpoint Overview
Method: `GET`

Path: `/transfers/evm/{address}`

Retrieves a list of token transfer events associated with the given address.

### Request Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Description | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------|
| address | (string, required) | The wallet address to query for token transfers. | Must be a valid hexadecimal address. Example: 0x1234abcd... |
| network_id | (string, optional) | Specifies the blockchain network to query. | Use this parameter when you need data from a specific EVM-compatible network. |
| limit | (integer, optional) | The maximum number of records to return. | Useful for controlling response size and paginating results. |
| offset | (integer, optional) | The number of records to skip before returning results. | Use together with limit for pagination. |
| age | (integer, optional) | The number of days in the past to query | Defaults to `30`. Maximum is `180` |

### Response Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------|
| block_num | (integer) | The block number of the most recent balance change for the data queried. | Block numbers will differ between blockchains |
| timestamp | (integer) | The Unix timestamp, in seconds,  of the most recent balance change for the data queried. | Equals the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. |
| date | (string) | The date of the block from which data was queried. | In the format "YYYY-MM-DD". |
| contract | (string) | The contract involved in the token transfer. | Returned in hexadecimal. Example: 0x1234abcd... |
| from | (string) | The address that initiated the token transfer. | Returned in hexadecimal. Example: 0x1234abcd... |
| to | (string) | The address that received the token transfer. | Returned in hexadecimal. Example: 0x1234abcd... |
| amount | (string) | The amount of tokens sent in the transfer. | Returned as an integer, in the smallest divisible units of the token. |
| decimals | (integer) | The number of decimal places of precision for the specified token. | Use together with amount to determine token amount. |
| symbol | (string) | The number of records to skip before returning results. | Use together with limit for pagination. |
| network_id | (string) | The number of records to skip before returning results. | Use together with limit for pagination. |


### Additional Notes

The field `amount` returns an integer number. This is the number of smallest divisible units of the token that is held by the address. Use the `decimals` field to determine how many of those digits are to the right of the decimal point.

For example, the token for Ethereum has 18 decimal places, and the smallest unit of Ether is one Wei. The `amount` field will return the number of Wei, not the number of Ether. To determine the number of Ether, you would use `decimals` to determine how far from the last digit the decimal is placed, in this case 18 digits.
