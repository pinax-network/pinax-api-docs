---

The EVM Balances endpoint returns the current balances of native and ERC-20 tokens held by a specified wallet address on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain. The endpoint provides a snapshot of an account's current token holdings.

### Endpoint Overview
Method: `GET`

Path: `/balances/evm/{address}`

Retrieves a list of tokens along with the respective balances for the given wallet address.

### Request Parameters 
| Parameter | Type | Description | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------|
| address | (string, required) | The wallet address to query for token balances. | Must be a valid hexadecimal address. Example: 0x1234abcd... |
| chain | (string, optional) | Specifies the blockchain network to query. | Use this parameter when you need data from a specific EVM-compatible network. |
| limit | (number, optional) | The maximum number of records to return. | Useful for controlling response size and paginating results. |
| offset | (number, optional) | The number of records to skip before returning results. | Use together with limit for pagination. |
| contract | (string, optional) | The contract from which results are returned | Use to filter for specific token contracts |

### Response Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------|
| block_num | (number) | The block number from which data was queried. | Block numbers will differ between blockchains |
| timestamp | (number) | The Unix timestamp of the block from which data was queried, in seconds. | Equals the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. |
| date | (string) | The date of the block from which data was queried. | In the format "YYYY-MM-DD". |
| contract | (string) | The contract for the returned token balance. | Returned in hexadecimal. Example: 0x1234abcd... |
| amount | (string) | The amount of tokens held by the address. | Returned as an integer, in the smallest divisible units of the token. |
| decimals | (number) | The number of decimal places of precision for the specified token. | Use together with amount to determine token amount. |
| symbol | (string) | The number of records to skip before returning results. | Use together with limit for pagination. |
| network_id | (string) | The number of records to skip before returning results. | Use together with limit for pagination. |


### Additional Notes:

The field `amount` returns an integer number. This is the number of smallest divisible units of the token that is held by the address. Use the `decimals` field to determine how many of those digits are to the right of the decimal point.

For example, the token for Ethereum has 18 decimal places, and the smallest unit of Ether is one Wei. The `amount` field will return the number of Wei, not the number of Ether. To determine the number of Ether, you would use `decimals` to determine how far from the last digit the decimal is placed, in this case 18 digits.
