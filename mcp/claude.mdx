## Configuration

- You will need [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) or [`bunx`](https://bun.sh/) installed and available in your path.
- Authenticate via https://thegraph.market/ by `Create New Key` & `Generate Access Token`.

You will need to edit your `claude_desktop_config.json` file. If it doesn't exist, you can create one.

**Config location**
- OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-pinax": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@pinax/mcp",
        "--auth-token",
        "<your-jwt-token>",
        "--sse-url",
        "https://token-api.service.pinax.network/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Troubleshooting

To enable logs for the MCP, use the `--verbose true` option.

Try to use the full path of the command instead:
- Run `which npx` or `which bunx` to get the path of the command
- Replace `npx` or `bunx` in the configuration file with the full path

Example: `/home/user/bin/bunx`

> Server disconnected

Double-check your API key otherwise look in your navigator if `https://token-api.service.pinax.network/sse` is reachable.

> [!NOTE]
> You can always have a look at the full logs under `Claude/logs/mcp.log` and `Claude/logs/mcp-server-pinax.log` for more details.
