## Quickstart

### Overview
The Pinax Token API lets you access blockchain token information easily via a simple GET request. This guide will walk you through how to set up your environment and test your first API call.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, please ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- A modern web browser or terminal: For testing API calls.
- Node.js and npm: To run the JavaScript example. Download Node.js if you don’t have it.
- cURL: Most Unix-like systems come with cURL preinstalled. For Windows, you may need to install cURL.
- Additionally, you’ll need an API Key which you can obtain by signing up on [The Graph Market](https://thegraph.market/).

### Setting Up Your Environment
Using JavaScript (Node.js)
Create a New Directory:

```bash
mkdir pinax-token-api
cd pinax-token-api
```
Initialize a New Node.js Project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Make an API request using **Javascript** by adding the request code to `index.js`. For example:
```javascript index.js
const address = "0x2a0c0dbecc7e4d658f48e01e3fa353f44050c208";
const options = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'X-Api-Key': '<...>'
  }
};

fetch(`https://beta.api.pinax.network/balances/evm/${address}`, options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```
Make sure to replace `'X-Api-Key': '<...>'` with your API key, replacing the entire `<...>` with your key. 

For example: `'X-Api-Key': '77c6d67a3d1bca232ac5460fe08b2db0294c3e8fe2ad17b9'`

### Ensure `node-fetch` is installed
If you are using Node.js v18 or later, the fetch API is built-in. Otherwise, install it with:

```bash
npm install node-fetch
```

## Using cURL (Command Line)
To make an API request using **cURL**, open your terminal and run the following command. Be sure to replace `<...>` with your actual API key:

```curl
curl --request GET \
  --url https://beta.api.pinax.network/v1/balances/evm/0x2a0c0dbecc7e4d658f48e01e3fa353f44050c208 \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: <...>'
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an API key inserted in header as `X-Api-Key`.

You can obtain an API key by signing up on the [The Graph Market](https://thegraph.market/).

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "X-Api-Key": "<...>"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- Invalid API Key:
Ensure that you have replaced <...> with your actual API key. A common error message will indicate if your key is missing or invalid.

- Network Issues:
If you experience network errors or timeouts, verify that your internet connection is stable and that there are no firewall restrictions blocking your request.

- Node.js Compatibility:
If you’re encountering issues with the fetch API in Node.js, check your Node version. For versions older than v18, use the node-fetch package.

- Debugging:
If the API call fails, try printing out the full response object for additional error details. For example:
```javascript index.js
fetch(`https://beta.api.pinax.network/balances/evm/${address}`, options)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Status Code:', response.status);
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.error('Error:', err));
```
